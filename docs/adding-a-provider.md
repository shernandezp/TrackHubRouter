# Adding a GPS provider to the Router

This guide is for developers integrating a new GPS tracking platform ("provider") into
TrackHub. A provider is a self-contained class library inside the Router solution that
translates one external API into the Router's uniform contracts. Providers are **compiled in,
activated by configuration**: every provider project ships with the Router, and
`AppSettings:Protocols` decides which ones register at startup. There is no runtime plugin
loading — a misconfigured or missing provider fails **at startup**, loudly, on purpose.

Existing providers to crib from: `Traccar` (simplest — static Basic-auth header),
`Samsara`/`Flespi`/`GpsGate` (static token header), `Wialon`/`Navixy` (login → session id,
cached), `Geotab` (vendor SDK, cached session), `CommandTrack`/`Protrack` (bearer token with
absolute expiry, persisted back to Manager). **Traccar is the recommended template.**

---

## 1. The contract

A provider implements up to three interfaces (`TrackHub.Router.Domain.Interfaces`), each in its
own class with an **exact, convention-bound name**:

| Class name | Interface | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DeviceReader` | `IExternalDeviceReader` | Device-catalog sync (SyncWorker + manual "sync now") |
| `PositionReader` | `IPositionReader` | Position sync loop + on-demand position queries |
| `ConnectivityTester` | `IConnectivityTester` | 1-minute health PING loop + operator "ping" button |

Registering at least one of the three is enough to pass startup validation, but a production
provider should implement all three. **The two capabilities clients actually depend on are
real-time positions and position history** (both on `IPositionReader`); everything else supports
the platform's own plumbing (catalog reconciliation, health monitoring).

### Capability declaration

What your provider supports is declared centrally in
`Domain/Constants/ProviderCapabilityCatalog.cs` (`ProtocolType` → `ProviderCapability` flags:
`RealTimePositions`, `PositionHistory`, `DeviceCatalog`, `ConnectivityPing`). This catalog is the
**client-facing truth**: the `providerCapabilities` GraphQL query exposes it, and a request for an
undeclared capability fails with the typed error `PROVIDER_CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED`
(`ProviderCapabilityNotSupportedException`), whose message attributes the limitation to the GPS
provider — never a masked server error a paying client would read as a TrackHub defect, and never
confused with `FEATURE_DISABLED` (TrackHub account gating).

If the provider's API genuinely lacks position history (GpsGate is the precedent), declare the
entry without `PositionHistory` and implement `GetPositionAsync(from, to, ...)` as a stub that
throws `ProviderCapabilityNotSupportedException` — callers check the catalog first, the stub is
defense in depth. History is the only capability a shipped `PositionReader` may stub out; startup
cross-checks every other declaration against the reader classes actually present in your assembly
and throws on any mismatch (a declared capability with no backing reader, or an implemented reader
the catalog hides).

Shared semantics:

- **`Protocol` property** — return your `ProtocolType` enum value. The registries resolve
  readers keyed by this value; a mismatch with the enum/config spelling is caught at startup.
- **`Init(CredentialTokenDto credential, CancellationToken ct)`** — called before *every* batch
  of calls (each sync cycle, each query, each ping). It receives the operator's **decrypted**
  credential (`Uri`, `Username`, `Password`, optional `Key`/`Key2`/`Token` + expirations —
  which fields carry what is a per-provider convention you define). Init must:
  - build the `HttpClient` through `ICredentialHttpClientFactory` (never `new HttpClient()` —
    the factory applies the hardened named client: auto-redirect disabled, 30 s timeout) and
    hand it to `IHttpClientService.Init`;
  - **be cheap on repeat calls** — if your provider requires a login round-trip, cache the
    session artifact in `IProviderSessionStore` (see §3). Init runs for every operator on every
    cycle; an unconditional login is the difference between N cheap in-memory hits and N
    provider logins per minute at fleet scale.
- **Readers are keyed-transient and stateless between operators.** A new reader instance is
  constructed per lookup, so instance fields set in `Init` are safe; anything shared across
  instances (the session store) must be thread-safe.
- **Errors must throw, never degrade to empty results.** If your provider reports failures as
  HTTP 200 with an error payload (Wialon, Navixy do), detect it and throw
  `InvalidOperationException` with the provider error code. A swallowed error becomes a
  "successful" sync of 0 positions — the worst failure mode in this pipeline, because it
  silently stops position flow while Health stays green. The sync pipeline converts thrown
  exceptions into a FAILED sync run + `GpsOperatorPositionSyncFailed` alert + operator backoff.

### `IPositionReader`

```csharp
Task<PositionVm> GetDevicePositionAsync(DeviceTransporterVm device, CancellationToken ct);
Task<IEnumerable<PositionVm>> GetDevicePositionAsync(IEnumerable<DeviceTransporterVm> devices, CancellationToken ct);
Task<IEnumerable<PositionVm>> GetPositionAsync(DateTimeOffset from, DateTimeOffset to, DeviceTransporterVm device, CancellationToken ct);
```

- The plural overload is the sync-loop hot path — prefer ONE batched provider call over
  per-device calls whenever the API allows it.
- The `from`/`to` overload serves position history; timestamps are UTC `DateTimeOffset`
  everywhere (SVD-06). Convert at the provider boundary only.
- **Units contract** for `PositionVm`: speed in **km/h**, mileage in km, temperature in °C.
  Verify what the provider actually emits against a live instance — do not guess conversions
  (see RA-04: Traccar likely emits knots; unverified conversions are worse than documented raw
  values).
- **Attributes**: the five promoted fields (ignition/satellites/mileage/hourmeter/temperature)
  are strongly typed on `AttributesVm`; every other provider signal goes in the open `Extra`
  bag built with `Domain.Helpers.AttributesExtra`. Never add a cross-service schema field for
  a provider-specific signal. Attribute naming on the wire is TrackHub's, not the provider's —
  remap vendor spellings at your boundary (e.g. CommandTrack's `hobbsMeter` →
  `[JsonPropertyName("hobbsMeter")]` on a property named `Hourmeter`).

### `IExternalDeviceReader`

```csharp
Task<DeviceVm> GetDeviceAsync(DeviceTransporterVm device, CancellationToken ct);
Task<IEnumerable<DeviceVm>> GetDevicesAsync(IEnumerable<DeviceTransporterVm> devices, CancellationToken ct);
Task<IEnumerable<DeviceVm>> GetDevicesAsync(CancellationToken ct);
```

The parameterless overload returns the provider's full device catalog; it feeds the
device-sync loop that reconciles Manager's catalog (guarded per-operator by
`IOperatorSyncLock`, cached by `IDeviceCatalogCache`).

### `IConnectivityTester`

```csharp
Task Ping(CredentialTokenDto credential, CancellationToken ct);
```

`Ping` **must perform a real provider round-trip** — `Init` + one minimal authenticated call
(list one device, fetch server info). With session caching, `Init` alone may be a pure
in-memory hit and would turn the health monitor into a no-op that reports HEALTHY while the
provider is down. Success/failure of every ping and device-sync attempt is recorded as a
health observation (`DEVICE_SYNC` HEALTHY/OFFLINE) that drives the operator Health status in
the portal.

## 2. The five alignment points

Registration (`ProtocolRegistrationExtensions`, called from `AddCommonContext`) resolves
everything by convention. Five things must line up (names case-insensitively):

| # | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `TrackHubCommon` → `Common.Domain/Enums/ProtocolType.cs` | The enum value (e.g. `Wialon = 8`) |
| 2 | Provider `.csproj` | `AssemblyName` + `RootNamespace` = `TrackHub.Router.Infrastructure.{Protocol}` |
| 3 | Reader classes | `Protocol` property returns the enum value; class names exactly `DeviceReader` / `PositionReader` / `ConnectivityTester` in the root namespace |
| 4 | `AppSettings:Protocols` (Web + SyncWorker `appsettings.json`) | The enum spelling listed |
| 5 | `Domain/Constants/ProviderCapabilityCatalog.cs` | The capability declaration matching the reader classes (§1 *Capability declaration*) |

Any mismatch fails at startup with a message naming the protocol: unknown enum value,
missing assembly, an assembly with no matching reader types, or a capability declaration
that doesn't match the readers. An operator whose `ProtocolTypeId` has no registered reader
gets `ProtocolNotSupportedException` (naming the protocol) instead of a masked error.

> Casing may drift between config, enum, and namespace (`GeoTab` ↔ `Geotab`) — resolution is
> case-insensitive — but keep new providers consistent: folder, project, assembly, and
> namespace should all carry the same name as the enum value.

`Mettax = 10` is **reserved** in the enum with no provider assembly; configuring it throws at
startup until someone builds the project.

---

## 3. Session & token caching (`IProviderSessionStore`)

The singleton `IProviderSessionStore` (registered in `AddCommonContext`) keeps one session
artifact per credential so repeated `Init` calls don't re-authenticate:

```csharp
bool TryGet(CredentialTokenDto credential, out string session);
void Set(CredentialTokenDto credential, string session, TimeSpan timeToLive, bool sliding = true);
void Invalidate(Guid credentialId);
```

Entries are fingerprinted by the **full credential value** — a rotated password/token is
automatically a cache miss, never a stale session. Pick the pattern that matches your
provider's auth model:

| Auth model | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Static header (Basic auth, permanent API token) | No caching needed — `Init` is already free | Traccar, Samsara, Flespi, GpsGate |
| Login → inactivity-timeout session | `TryGet` in `Init`; on miss login + `Set` with a **sliding** TTL below the provider's inactivity timeout; on an invalid-session error mid-call: `Invalidate` + re-login + **retry once**, then throw | Wialon (sid, 4 min sliding), Navixy (hash, 30 min sliding) |
| Vendor SDK with session id | Cache the SDK session id; on a hit construct the SDK client with password **and** session id so the SDK self-heals an expired session; persist the current id after successful calls | Geotab |
| Bearer token with absolute expiry | Durable copy already lives on the Manager credential (`ICredentialWriter.UpdateTokenAsync`); `Set` with a **non-sliding** TTL of `expiry − now − margin` as an in-process fast path | CommandTrack, Protrack |

Rules regardless of pattern:

- The retry-once-on-invalid-session lives in the provider base class (`WialonReaderBase.PostAsync`,
  `NavixyReaderBase.PostNavixyAsync`) so readers stay oblivious. Copy that shape.
- Never let a cached session weaken error semantics: a second failure after re-login must
  throw, and `Ping` must still round-trip (§1).
- The store is in-process, matching the single-instance SyncWorker deployment (same as
  `IOperatorSyncLock` / `ExecutionIntervalManager`). If the worker is ever scaled out, session
  caching degrades gracefully (each instance logs in once) — no correctness issue.

## 4. Step-by-step

1. **Enum value** — add `{Protocol} = N` to `ProtocolType` in **TrackHubCommon**
   (`src/Common.Domain/Enums/ProtocolType.cs`), then repack/bump the Common packages and
   update consumers per the repack workflow (`dotnet build`, purge the global package cache,
   bump `Directory.Packages.props` in consuming repos). This is additive and non-breaking.
2. **Project** — create `src/Infrastructure/{Protocol}/{Protocol}.csproj`:

   ```xml
   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
     <PropertyGroup>
       <RootNamespace>TrackHub.Router.Infrastructure.{Protocol}</RootNamespace>
       <AssemblyName>TrackHub.Router.Infrastructure.{Protocol}</AssemblyName>
     </PropertyGroup>
     <ItemGroup>
       <ProjectReference Include="..\..\Domain\Domain.csproj" />
     </ItemGroup>
   </Project>
   ```

   (TargetFramework/nullable/warnings-as-errors come from `Directory.Build.props`.)
3. **Implement** — `{Protocol}ReaderBase` (Init + auth + session caching + shared HTTP
   helpers), `DeviceReader`, `PositionReader`, `ConnectivityTester`, `Models/` (provider DTOs,
   `internal`), `Mappers/` (static extension methods to `DeviceVm`/`PositionVm` — mapping is
   manual, no AutoMapper).
4. **Declare capabilities** — add the protocol's entry to
   `Domain/Constants/ProviderCapabilityCatalog.cs` (§1 *Capability declaration*). Startup
   cross-checks the declaration against your reader classes.
5. **Wire the build** — add the project to `TrackHub.Router.slnx` and a `ProjectReference` in
   `src/Infrastructure/Common/Common.csproj` (that reference is what puts your DLL in the
   Web/SyncWorker output).
6. **Activate** — add the protocol name to `AppSettings:Protocols` in **both**
   `src/Web/appsettings.json` and `src/SyncWorker/appsettings.json` (deployed environments:
   `AppSettings__Protocols__N` env vars, see `TrackHub.Deployment`).
7. **Portal** — add `{ value: N, label: '{PROTOCOL}' }` to `TrackHub/src/data/protocolTypes.ts`
   (values mirror the enum — this list feeds the operator dialog's protocol select).
8. **Tests** — add `{Protocol}DeviceReaderTests` / `{Protocol}PositionReaderTests` in
   `tests/Intfrastructure.UnitTests` deriving from `DeviceReaderTestsBase<T>` /
   `PositionReaderTestsBase<T>` (mocks for `ICredentialHttpClientFactory`,
   `IHttpClientService`, `IProviderSessionStore` are provided). Cover: happy-path mapping,
   empty results, provider-error payloads (must throw), and — if you cache sessions — the
   re-login-and-retry path.
9. **Verify** — `dotnet build TrackHub.Router.slnx && dotnet test TrackHub.Router.slnx`, then
   start the Web project: startup throws if any alignment point is off. Finally create an
   operator with the new protocol and use **Ping** + **Sync now** in the portal against a live
   account.

No Security/Manager permission work is needed — provider calls go outward with the operator's
credential, not through the service-client grant system.

---

## 5. Runtime behavior you inherit (nothing to build)

- **Concurrency**: accounts sync concurrently under the global operator gate
  (`AppSettings:MaxConcurrentOperatorSyncs`, default 10). Two same-protocol operators in one
  scope get separate reader + `HttpClientService` instances.
- **Failure handling**: a thrown provider error → FAILED sync run (with your message) +
  `GpsOperatorPositionSyncFailed` alert + exponential backoff (1→30 min) until first success.
- **Device catalog cache**: 60 s (`AppSettings:DeviceCatalogCacheSeconds`), invalidated by
  device sync — your `GetDevicesAsync` is not called every position cycle.
- **Health**: every ping/device-sync attempt records a HEALTHY/OFFLINE observation.
- **Rate limiting/auth**: manual sync and ping are authorized + rate-limited at the
  command layer (`Resources.Credentials`/`Actions.Custom`); your reader never checks callers.
- **HTTP hardening**: the shared named client disables auto-redirect (an operator-configured
  base URL cannot 302 the Router inward) and enforces the 30 s timeout.

## 6. Documentation & context upkeep

When the provider lands, update `TrackHub.wiki/Router.md` (supported protocols table) and
`system-context/architecture.md` if you introduced a new pattern; regenerate the machine
catalogs (`tools/Tools.McpExtractor`) per `system-context` maintenance.
